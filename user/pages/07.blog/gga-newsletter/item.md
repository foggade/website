Dear Friends
Trusting that you are all well!

It's time for an update, and to share all our latest news. The last 6 months have flown by and we have been very busy.
I will start with our 4 older girls who completed their schooling at Inanda Seminary in Dec 2015.

Televo, Slee, Nonjabula and Bongiwe.

3 of them have managed to find sponsorships to study further but unfortunately we could not find a sponsor to help Bongiwe. If you can assist please contact us.

School started on the 16th January.

Amanda Hlengwa has started High School and thanks to her sponsor was able to enrol at Inanda Seminary. What a Blessing and wonderful opportunity for her. She has settled in and did well in her first exams.

The other 22 children are continuing as before in Pmburg Primary, Linpark, Newton, Marion High, Capulum Academy, Peter Pan, Wendon Academy, and 2 in pre primary.

and then of course the exciting news this year was Lucky's graduation from AFDA,  with his Bachelor of Arts degree in,  Motion Picture Medium

Great achievement. He worked hard for it. It's a tough 3 year degree! Special thanks to all his sponsors!!!

At the same time we would like to take this opportunity to thank all our sponsors!! Your financial support and sponsorship ensures life -changing results for all these children!! Thank you!

Our athletic team has done well. All members qualified in the Natal Witness and Mandela Marathon, with times good enough to enter the gruelling Comrades Marathon. An 89 kilometer race from PMBurg to Durban. God's Golden Acre is an affiliated Club in the Comrades Marathon and we have 28 runners running again this year. Brendan will not make it due to his severe knee injuries obtained in the attack earlier this year, but he has been training Fred who shows amazing natural talent!! So we wish them all the very best, and well done guys for getting this far! Sihle is doing a sterling job for our athletes, supported by Brendan.

Patrick and I have recovered remarkably from the injuries we received during the attack earlier this year. We are truly grateful that we survived . Both of us were critical when we arrived at the hospital. We thank each and everyone one of you that held us up in your thoughts and prayers during those difficult weeks that followed.
Because of the two vicious and life threatening attacks it was decided that we needed to employ armed guards for the safety of all those who live here. 14 attacks had been made on neighbouring farms and on other NPO'S. (Non Profit Organisations) Drug addiction is the main culprit for the formation these gangs, (they need money to pay for their addictions) it is suspected there is a syndicate involved in selling all the stolen goods.
The security guards are costing alot of extra money. We appeal to everyone to please help if posible, towards these extra costs each month. The safety of everyone at GGA is our highest priority.

The Young Zulu Warriors will be touring Germany, NÄºherlands and France, in June/July 2016. Everyone is excited and much work and planning is going on.

We will post dates and venues soon. Thank you to everyone involved in helping host and plan the concerts. We are truly grateful for all the work you have done ! Soon we will all share a marvellous month of Zulu Traditional Song and Dance, renew old friendships, and make new ones. This is an opportunity to showcase the work done by God's Golden Acre at each concert, raising awareness and much needed funds. Tour dates are Germany 9th June to 15th June, Netherlands, 15th to 29th June, France 29th to 7th July 2016.

Our Child sponsorship programme is running well. Thank you, Eline Bakker Hermen Fikse, Dari Huiskes and Nozipho for all your commitnent and hard work here at God's Golden Acre, and Marion Freriksen our CSP Co Ordinator from The Friends of GGA Board in the Netherlands. We are very grateful for all your support and commitment. Very much appreciated.

Shereen is still running the kitchen like a well oiled machine. She is a jewel!! Keeping us all happy and well fed.

Evelyn Marx is still our School liaison Officer and she is doing a wonderful job. She is also running a cell group and sponsors weekly trips to evening Church services in Hillcrest, which the children love.

Our Youth Choir performed last week at the City Hill Church in Hillcrest and they had a great reception.

We have had so many visitors in the last 5 months, many old volunteers and supporters from USA, Europe and UK. Too numerous to mention.. it was wonderful to have you all back! We are truly Blessed to have such special friends and supporters around the world!! Thank you all for your visits and for the new memories made and left behind, they will not be easily forgotten.

Special thanks to those of you who support the vehicle fund. This has made a huge difference to the safety of our old vehicles. Many thanks!!
Friends of GGA Nl and Friends of GGA No you are the financial foundation of all the work done here at God's Golden Acre. Words cannot express our gratitude to you and all your supporters. Friends of GGA De thank you for becoming another pillar of strength to support the work we do. I pray this tour to Germany will see many more members joining you and supporting our work.

I will end now by wishing you God's Richest Blessings. May His love and Peace be with you, now and always.

Much love and with many greetings

Heather and the God's Golden Acre Family
